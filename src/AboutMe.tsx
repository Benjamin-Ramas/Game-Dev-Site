            <p>Hello I am Benjamin Ramas. I got interested in game development in 2020 when I first started tinkering with Python. I then learned about Unity and from then on that has been my main method of creating video games.</p>
            <p>I have a variety of other interests such as web development which is how I made this website right here. I also have an interest in 3d modelling in Blender, pixel art in aseprite, digital drawing with Krita. All of which I try to use on my own games when I could.</p>
